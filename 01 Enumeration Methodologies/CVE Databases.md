A good place to start is the [Rapid7 Database](https://www.rapid7.com/db/). This database is from the creators of Metasploit, and lists Metasploit modules for vulnerabilities if they exist. Although there is not as many vulnerabilities on this database compared to others, it's a quick win if a module exists.

[Exploit-DB](https://www.exploit-db.com/) has less vulnerabilities than NVD, but has more than Rapid7. ExploitDB only publishes vulneribilities if an exploit is publically available, so is another quick win if a relevant exploit is available.

The [US National Vulnerbility Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln) has many more niche/obscure/low profile vulnerabilties compared to the Rapid7 and Exploit-DB database, however there is no technical information beyond a basic description for most vulnerabilities. It is a comprehensive database of all vulnerabilities with an associated CVE number. Unpatched vulnerabilities will not contain details.
