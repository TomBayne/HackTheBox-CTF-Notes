`ad-ldap-enum`  is a tool from [CroweSecurity](https://github.com/CroweCybersecurity/ad-ldap-enum). 

The tool can be used to enumerate lots of information from an AD server, and can be ran in both authenticated and unauthenticated mode.

**Information Enumerated:**
- Users, Computers, Groups
- Group Memberships
- Information about users
- Information about domain computers (OS Type, Service Pack Version)
- The FQDN of a server if not already known known (See [[Scrambled]] as an example of this use case)
